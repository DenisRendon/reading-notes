### HTML Tables
1. A table represents info in a grid format
2. Grids alllow us to undersatnd complex dada by referencing information on wo axes. Each block in the grid is known as a table cell.
3. table> element is creates a table
4. tr> the start of each row
5. td> each cell of an element
6. th> table heading
7. thead> heading of the table should sit in this element
8. tbody> the body sits in here
9. tfoot> table footer
10. You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan

### Functions, Methods, Objects
1. Functjons allow you to group a set of related statements togther that repersent a task
2. Functions can take paramaters and may return a value
3. An obj is a series of vars and functions that represent somthing from the world
4. In a obj var are known as properties of the obj, functions are know as Methods
5. Web browsers implement objs that represent both the browser and the documentation
6. JS has several build in objs - string, number,math,date-
7. Arrays and objs can be used to create complex data sets


### Things I want to know more about
1. I want to get good at inputing data into tables. I kind of like the data building
and storage of information. Tables seem like just another bunch of HTML keys that kind of the do same thing as a few other tags we learned in w1.
I want to countine exploring objs and functions and getting better so I can loop through information much easier.
