# Reading 08 MOAR CSS
- Learn CSS - Layout
- Duckett HTML/CSS book: Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading
### Layout
1. Multiple CSS files can be applied to one page
2. browsers display pages in normal flow, unless you specify relative, absolute or fixed position for the page
3. flot moves content to the left or right of the page
4. pages can be setup to be fixed or liquid 
5. grids make your page look professional and not like clip art
6. CSS frameworks provide rules for tasks




### Things I want to learn more about
1. I play to use alot of these layout temps this week for our team project.
