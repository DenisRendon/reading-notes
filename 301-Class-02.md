Readings: State and Props

### React lifecycle

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
- Render will happen first once shouldComponentUpdate() returns true, then componentDidMount is next

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
- The constructor is called before it is mounted

3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
- constructor
- React Updates
- render
- componentDidMount
- componentWillUnmount

4. What does componentDidMount do?
- It cleans the DOM and network requests and subscriptons


### React State Vs Props
1. What types of things can you pass in the props?
- Props are like the pramaters of a function, you can pass a counter
- Displays info, is a var to a function, 
- Dont change


2. What is the big difference between props and state?
- State are handled inside the component and props are handled outside 
- Changing / updating state rerenders the application 


3. When do we re-render our application?
-  When we change something in the state that you stored it will rerender the application


4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
- short, medium and long term data




### Things I want to learn more about
1. It is interesting how state works, I want to start seeing and using some examples so I can get a better picture of it. I kind of understand props but state seems like youre able to have alot of control and options
