### Reading 14a

1. The transfrom property has two different settings, 2D and 3D each one has its own props and values
2. Transform prop accpets multiple values, rotate provies the ability to rotate an element 0 - 360. Postive value clockwise, negatice counterclockwise. 
3. Scale trahsforms the appared size of an element. default is 1 so anything between .99 - .01 adjusts the size and any value greater than or = to 1.01 makes it bigger.
4. In order for 3D transformations need a perspecive to transform, It can be set in 2 different ways. 
5. I really like the simple CSS transitions, I think the square to circle and shadows really make the page pop.
