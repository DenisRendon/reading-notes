- JS Basic JS 70-73 Decsions and Loops 162-182
Lists boxes and loops are apart of every webpage and can be seen all over the place. Getting a good understanding of something so widely used will help create better performing products. 

### Lists
---

1. Ordered lists - each item in the list is numbered. Uses numbers
- ol> - ordered list
- li> - list item

2. Unordered lists - lits that begin with a bullet. Uses bullets
- ul> - unordered list
- li> - list item

3. Definition lists - made up with aset of terms, also with the terms definitions. Uses defined terms
- dl> - definition list - consits of a series of terms and definitions

- dt> - defined terms
- dd> - Definition 

Lists can be nested inside onanother

### Boxes
---
1. Bordering, Margin and padding 
- Every box has 3 available properties that can be adjusted to control its appererance. 
- Border
- Margin
- Padding

2. White space and vertical margin 
- padding and margin properties are helpful in adding space between items on the page. 

3. 
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box
- you can control the boarders, margins and padding for each box with CSS
- Its possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes
- Legibility can be improved by controling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to creat inage boarders and rounded boarders

1. 
- Arrays store not just one value but a list of values
- Use an array if you are working with a list of related values
- Two different types of ways to create an array, array literal var coffee , coffee = ['black', 'capi'] and array constructor(uses the keyword (new)before the array. ex new Array()


2. Switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this var and the code that should run if the var matches that value.

3. if else 
- There is no need to provide an else option( you can use jus the if if you need to)
- With a series of if statements they are all checked even if a match has been found, it performs slower than switch

- VS 

4. Switch
- You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match
- If a match is found that code is run, then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running, providing better performance than multiple if statements

5. Decisions and Loops
- Conditional statements allow your code to make decsions about what to do next
- Comparision operator(===, !==, ==, !=, <,>, <=,=>) are used to compare two operands
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators
- if... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true and another if it is faluse
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcoomes, and also privoes a default option if none match
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another
- all values evaluate to either truthy or falsy
- ther are 3 type sof loop: for, while and do...while. Each repeats a set of statements


### Things I want to know more about
1. Switch statements and seeing some in real time
2. Get a better understand of if..else statements
