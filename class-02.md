- ### CSS 
1. CSS trears each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
2. Rules are made up of selectors that specify the elements that rule applies to, and declarations that indicate what these elements should look like.
3. Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
4. Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example the font-family property sets the cgouce of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the perferred typeface.
5. CSS rules usually appear in a separate doc, although they may appear within an HTML page.

- ### Basic JavaScript
1. Ascript is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a workbook.
2. Scripts contain very precise instructions. you might specift that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
3. Variables are unsed to temporarily store pieces of information unsed in the script.
4. Arrats are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information
5. JS distinguishes between numbers, strings, and Bools
6. Expressions evaluate into a single value.
7. Expressions rely on operators to caluate a value.
